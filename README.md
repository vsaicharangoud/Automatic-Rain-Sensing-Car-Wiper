# 🚗💧Automatic Rain Sensing Car Wipers

This project is an **Arduino-based automatic car wiper system** that activates the wipers automatically when rain is detected, removing the need for driver input. It will improve road safety by reducing distractions caused by manual wiper control.

## How It Works:
- A **rain sensor** detects the presence of water (raindrops).
- When rain is detected, the **Arduino UNO** triggers a **servo motor**, simulating the wiper movement.
- Once the rain stops, the system turns off the wiper automatically.
- No manual action is required by the driver.
