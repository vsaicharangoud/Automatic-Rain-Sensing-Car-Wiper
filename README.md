# 🚗💧Automatic Rain Sensing Car Wipers

This project automatically detects rainfall using a rain sensor and activates car wipers using servo motors.  
It adjusts wiper speed based on rain intensity using Arduino.

## How It Works:
- A **rain sensor** detects the presence of water (raindrops).
- When rain is detected, the **Arduino UNO** triggers a **servo motor**, simulating the wiper movement.
- Once the rain stops, the system turns off the wiper automatically.
- No manual action is required by the driver.
